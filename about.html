    <h2>About the Blog</h2>

    <p>I’m a high schooler with a laptop and a dream. That’s it. That’s the vibe.</p>

    <p>This blog started because I watched too much TV—specifically <em>The Flash</em>,and somehow got way too into forensic science. Like, how blood spatter patterns work. How fingerprint ridges are unique. How people leave a trail without even realizing it.</p>

    <p>But somewhere along the way, I got more interested in the why than the how. Why people commit crimes. Why they choose certain victims. Why they confess—or don’t. Suddenly, I was less into chemical analysis and more into criminal minds. So now I’m diving into forensic psychology too: criminal profiling, courtroom behavior, mental state evaluations, all that messy, fascinating human brain stuff.</p>

    <p>Is this a passion project? Technically, yes. But it’s also a chaotic glimpse into how I think (okay Plato). I’m not pretending to be an expert or writing like a textbook. I’m just trying to understand how forensics works in the real world, like both the lab evidence and the mental clues people leave behind.</p>

    <p>Most posts are based on real cases or actual science. I dig through articles, interviews, documentaries, research papers, and the occasional Wikipedia panic spiral. Then I try to explain it to myself and post it here. That’s the whole process.</p>

    <p>If you’re reading this: hi. Welcome to <em>Trace of Evidence</em>. I don’t know everything, but I’m figuring it out. Jesus that sounds like a 2000s movie ending, gross.</p>
