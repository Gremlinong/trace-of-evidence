      <h2>Why I Want to Learn Forensics</h2>
      <p>I don’t have experience. I don’t have credentials. What I have is a laptop and a dream.An a a suspicious amount of curiosity, and an unhealthy interest in why people do terrible things. (calm down, feds)</p>
      <p>This blog is where I teach myself about forensics, from fingerprints and blood spatter to behavior analysis and criminal psychology. Basically, I want to understand both the traces people leave behind and the minds that left them there.</p>
      <p>Also, I think science is cool and bones are weird.</p>
