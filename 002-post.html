      <h2>Locard’s Exchange Principle and the Case That Got It Wrong: Kristine Bunch (1995)</h2>

      <p>I started this post thinking I’d talk about Locard’s Principle and like, fiber evidence or maybe a hair left on a doorknob. Instead, I looked into a case where the principle was technically used correctly, but the science? The interpretation? The entire forensic thing? All wrong. WRONG. ahem—</p>

      <p>Kristine Bunch was wrongfully convicted of arson and murder because investigators thought they found proof she set her trailer on fire. What they actually found was: a kerosene heater. And a ton of bad science built on misread burn marks and outdated assumptions.</p>

      <p><strong>What Is Locard’s Exchange Principle?</strong></p>
      <p>This is Forensics 101. Edmond Locard said:</p>
      <blockquote>Every contact leaves a trace.</blockquote>
      <p>If you touch something, you leave something behind. And if you enter a space, that space leaves something on you. Hair, fibers, soil, skin cells, oil, cat hair, whatever—you bring evidence with you, and you take it with you when you go.</p>

      <p>In theory, that’s how you catch people. It’s a beautiful concept, truly (maybe Locard can thank me from his grave.) But if you misuse the traces—like if you don’t question what was transferred, how it got there, or <em>what it actually means</em>—you can build an entire case on a lie.</p>

      <p><strong>The Kristine Bunch Case (1995)</strong></p>
      <p><em>Hope, Indiana. June 30th, 1995.</em></p>
      <p>Kristine Bunch, 22, was home with her 3-year-old son, Tony, when her trailer went up in flames.</p>
      <p>Kristine survived the fire. Tony didn’t. And within hours, she was treated as a suspect.</p>

      <p><strong>Why did the investigators say she did it?</strong></p>

      <h3>“Multiple Points of Origin”</h3>
      <p>Firefighters said the burn damage in the living room and south bedroom looked like it came from two separate fires. In their minds, this meant the fires were set <strong>intentionally and separately</strong>, not from one accidental ignition.</p>

      <h3>“Pour Patterns” on the Floor</h3>
      <p>Investigators reported strange burn marks across the floor that LOOKED like someone had dumped gasoline or kerosene and lit it. These shapes were interpreted as “pour patterns.”</p>

      <h3>Presence of Accelerants</h3>
      <p>An ATF chemist claimed lab tests found petroleum distillates in samples from both rooms. This matched the “intentional arson” theory.</p>

      <p>These three things: multiple origins, pour patterns, and accelerant detection, were the whole case. It led to a 60-year sentence.</p>

      <p><strong>The Science (And Where It Failed)</strong></p>

      <h3>One Fire, Not Two</h3>
      <p>The fire started near a kerosene heater in the living room. Because trailers are highly flammable, it spread quickly, therefore creating the illusion of a second fire.</p>

      <h3>Pour Patterns Are Not Always Pour Patterns</h3>
      <p>The irregular burns were caused by flashover and synthetic materials—not accelerants. Old-school arson beliefs were just... wrong.</p>

      <h3>No Accelerants in the Bedroom</h3>
      <p>New analysis found no accelerants in the bedroom at all. The living room? Kerosene. From her space heater. That was... known. And ignored.</p>

      <p>This wasn't just bad science—it was <em>buried</em> science. The very evidence that could’ve cleared her was used to convict her.</p>

      <p><strong>So... What About Locard?</strong></p>
      <p>Locard's Principle was followed: they found trace chemicals. But the interpretation was wrong.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “We found a flammable substance. That must mean she poured it.”<br>
        —Investigator logic, 1995
      </blockquote>

      <p>The reality was that she lived there. The kerosene was from her heater. The “traces” weren’t criminal, they were environmental.</p>

      <p><em>Context</em> matters. A trace isn’t guilt. It’s a clue. And if you don’t interpret it right, you destroy lives.</p>

      <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
      <p>I came here for fiber analysis and “aha!” moments.</p>
      <p>Instead, I learned this: a trace is potential, not proof. Interpretation is everything.</p>

      <p><strong>Final Words</strong></p>
      <p>Locard’s Exchange Principle is iconic. But if you use it wrong, it stops being science and starts being a weapon.</p>

      <blockquote>Every contact leaves a trace. But not every trace tells the truth.</blockquote>
      <p>Sometimes it just tells you what you want to hear.</p>
